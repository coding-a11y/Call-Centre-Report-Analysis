Report Summary:
This report analyzes the key performance metrics, customer feedback, and operational data for the call center to improve service quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. The report was created using Power BI Desktop and published to Power BI Service to provide real-time insights into call center operations. The dashboard highlights essential metrics such as call volume, average call handling time, first call resolution, and customer satisfaction ratings, aiming to optimize call center performance and enhance customer experience.

Metrics and Calculations:
Step 1: Loading and Cleaning the Data The dataset was loaded into Power BI from a CSV file and cleaned using Power Query Editor. In the Power Query Editor, columns with missing or inconsistent values were reviewed, and necessary transformations were applied. Null values and errors were appropriately handled, and data types were corrected to ensure the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

Step 2: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Average Ratings The analysis focused on key call center metrics that directly affect customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Key KPIs such as call handling time, first call resolution, customer satisfaction, and agent performance were measured, and ratings were calculated for the following parameters:

Call Handling Time: 5.2 minutes
First Call Resolution (FCR): 87.5%
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): 4.05/5
Agent Utilization: 78.1%
Abandonment Rate: 3.4%
Service Level (Calls answered within 30 seconds): 91.3%
Step 3: Key Visualizations Added to the Dashboard

Branding:

Company name and tagline displayed using text boxes.
Call center logo inserted for visual branding.
Call Center Metrics:

A calculated column was created for customer satisfaction segmentation, call categories, and agent performance, allowing for deeper insights into specific call center activities.
Step 4: Total Call Volume and Customer Satisfaction Breakdown

Total Call Volume:

Total number of calls handled by the call center, displayed via a card visual, showing overall calls in terms of total volume and customer type distribution.
Customer Type Breakdown:

Customers were segmented into new and returning categories to evaluate repeat business and customer loyalty.
Returning customers: 65%
New customers: 35%
Step 5: Call Duration and Resolution Insights

Average Call Handling Time:

The average call handling time was calculated and tracked in a card visual.
Average handling time: 5.2 minutes.
First Call Resolution (FCR):

The percentage of issues resolved during the first call was tracked, with a focus on increasing this metric.
FCR rate: 87.5%.
Step 6: Service Level and Abandonment Rate

Service Level (Calls Answered within 30 Seconds):

This metric measures the percentage of calls answered in under 30 seconds, helping to understand how efficiently the call center is responding to customer inquiries.
Service level: 91.3%.
Call Abandonment Rate:

The percentage of calls that were abandoned before being answered.
Abandonment rate: 3.4%.
Insights from the Dashboard:
1. Total Call Volume

Total Call Volume: The call center handled a total of 250,000 calls during the analysis period.
The highest call volumes occurred between 9 AM and 12 PM, indicating peak hours for customer inquiries.
2. Call Handling Time

Average Call Handling Time: The average call duration is 5.2 minutes, with higher handling times observed in technical support queries.
Calls related to complex issues (e.g., technical support, account troubleshooting) took significantly longer than general inquiries.
3. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

Average CSAT: The overall customer satisfaction score was 4.05/5.
Positive feedback highlighted agents' professionalism and helpfulness, while negative feedback was mostly related to longer wait times and unresolved issues in the first call.
4. First Call Resolution (FCR)

First Call Resolution (FCR): The FCR rate stands at 87.5%, which is a good indicator of the effectiveness of the agents in resolving customer issues on the first call. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing more complex or time-consuming inquiries.
5. Service Level

Service Level: With 91.3% of calls answered within 30 seconds, the call center is performing well, but further improvements could be made during peak times.
6. Call Abandonment Rate

Abandonment Rate: The abandonment rate of 3.4% suggests that while the call center is generally responsive, a small number of customers are abandoning their calls, particularly during periods of high call volume.
Recommendations:
1. Enhance Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

Focus on improving the customer service experience by addressing negative feedback. Work on reducing call wait times and improving first call resolution rates.
Invest in better training for agents to handle complex queries more efficiently.
2. Optimize Call Handling Time

Focus on reducing the average call handling time by streamlining call scripts, improving agent training, and utilizing knowledge bases for quicker issue resolution.
Implement self-service options for common inquiries to reduce call volumes and speed up resolution times.
3. Increase First Call Resolution (FCR)

Aim to increase the FCR rate by ensuring agents have the necessary tools and information to resolve issues in a single call.
Implement a more robust knowledge management system to help agents resolve issues more quickly.
4. Improve Call Center Efficiency

Review agent schedules and workloads to optimize staffing levels during peak hours and reduce wait times. This can be done by redistributing workloads or utilizing part-time agents during busy periods.
Continue monitoring service level metrics to ensure that calls are answered promptly.
5. Reduce Call Abandonment Rates

Implement better call routing strategies to ensure that customers are quickly connected to the appropriate agents. Consider adding more agents during high-traffic periods to reduce abandonment rates.
Introduce a callback option to mitigate customer frustration during long wait times.
By implementing these recommendations, the call center can enhance its service delivery, increase customer satisfaction, and improve operational efficiency.
